Added mean of spectral entropies                                        0.554
Added mean of spectral flux                                             0.577
Added mean of zero crossing rate                                        0.6
Added max of zero crossing rate                                         0.588 (worse wtf)
Removed the previous bullshit and added mean of spectral contrast       0.583 (even worse what the fuck)
